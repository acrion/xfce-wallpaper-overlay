.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xfce\-wallpaper\-overlay
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xfce\-wallpaper\-overlay
is a utility that automatically overlays the XFCE wallpaper with text or images from files located in ~/.config/xfce\-wallpaper\-overlay. It runs in the background and updates the wallpaper whenever the original wallpaper changes or when the overlay configuration files are modified.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The overlay content is configured through files placed in the ~/.config/xfce\-wallpaper\-overlay directory. Each file in this directory represents a column on the wallpaper.
.SS Text Overlay
To display text, simply create a file with the desired content. The text will be rendered in the corresponding column on the wallpaper. Please make sure to use line breaks because no word wrapping is done. The font size is determined by the longest line.

.PP
.nf
/path/to/image.png[:percentage]
.fi
.PP
Where:
.IP \(bu 2
